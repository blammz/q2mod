# Quake2HarvestMod
For this mod I tried to make some kind of harvest moon/ farming sim for my quake 2 mod.

The deliverables for this project were:
  1.  Shortcut that Auto-Launches your Mod
  2.  Mod in a Separate Folder
  3.  README file in GIT that explains HOWTO install and play / test your mod
  4.  UI updates reflecting your Personal Deliverables
  5.  Help Screen to detail how to play your mod in game

Personal Deliverables were:
1: Plant and grow crops

2: variety of crops 5 diff crops

3: market/shop to sell and buy

4: 5 Farming tools

5: Farm Animals


To test this mod:

First download and put moddy into the game directory, taking the shortcut as well.

There you can either launch into it using the shortcut or launch the mod in game.

Now for actual Testing:
You will first need to give yourself some grenades and some money
- you can use givemoney and give grenades for that
- then you can open up the shop menu/help menu with f1
- after which buy turnips and a sickle, you start with a watering can(blaster)
- press f8 to cycle through your seeds if your not on the right one NOTHING WILL HAPPEN AND THE GRENADE WILL JUST EXPLODE
- but if you are it will spawn a turnip or (beserk)
- first water it with the watering can
- then kill it with the sickle, if you just kill it without watering you get no crops, if you kill it after watering you get 1 crop, if you kill it with a sickle it will drop 3 crops
- you can also sell the crops you get into the shop for money using sell "" ex sell turnip
- you can buy and harvest produce from animals as well, there is a cow and sheep which drop milk and wool respectively
- however you need the correct tools for this so buy a shear and bucket from the shop
